## 📌 Project Overview  
This project presents a **YouTube Data Analysis Dashboard** developed in **Power BI**.  
The dashboard is built using two cleaned datasets:  

- **Channel Master Dataset** → Provides details of channels, uploaders, subscribers, views, and languages.  
- **Video Summary Dataset** → Provides insights into individual videos, including views, likes, and engagement metrics.  

By combining both datasets, the dashboard delivers a comprehensive view of YouTube performance, from the top-level channel perspective to detailed video-level analysis.
